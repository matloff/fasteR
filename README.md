## Overview:

The site is for those who know nothing of R or even of programming, and
seek a quick, painless entree to the world of R.

* *FAST*:  You'll already be doing good stuff -- useful data analysis
--- in R in your very first lesson.

* No prerequisites:  If you're comfortable with navigating the Web,
you're fine.  This tutorial is aimed at you, not experienced
C or Python coders.

* No polemics:  You won't be made to feel guilty for not using an
instructor's favorite R tool or style, including mine. :-)

* No frills:  E.g. no IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
RStudio, ESS etc. are great, but you shouldn't be burdened with
learning R *and* learning an IDE at the same time.  This can come later,
optionally.

* "When in doubt, Try it out!"  This is a motto I devised for teaching.
If you are unclear or curious about something, try it out!  Just devise
a little experiment, and type in the code.  Don't worry -- you won't
"break" things.

* Nonpassive approach:  Passive learning, just watching the screen is NO
learning.  There will be occasional **Your Turn** sections, in which you the 
learner must devise and try your own variants on what has been presented.
Sometimes the tutorial will be give you some suggestions, but even then,
you should cook up your own variants to try.

* Contribute your own lessons!:  Yes, "your name in lights"; see below.

For the time being, the main part of this online course will be this
**README.md** file.  It is set up as a potential R package, though, and
I may implement that later.

GPL-3:  Permission granted to copy/modify, provided the source (N. Matloff) is
stated.  No warranties.

The color figure at the top of this file was generated by our **prVis**
package, run on a famous dataset called *Swiss Roll*.

## Please note again:  

* You will just be using R from the command line here.  Most tutorials,
say the excellent one by [R-Ladies
Sydney](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1119025557830684673.html),
start with RStudio.  It is a very attractive, powerful IDE.  But even the
R-Ladies tutorial laments that RStudio can be "overwhelming."  Here we
stick to the R command line, and focus on data analysis, not advanced
tools.

* Nonpassive learning is absolutely key!  So even if the output of an R
command is shown here, run the command yourself in your R console,
by copy-and-pasting from this document.

* Similarly, the **Your Turn** sections are absolutely crucial.  Devise
your own little examples, and try them out!

* Also similarly:  I cannot *teach* you how to program.  I can merely
give you the tools, e.g. R vectors, and some examples.  For a given
desired programming task, then, you must creatively put these tools
together to attain the goal.  Treat it like a puzzle!  I think you'll
find that if you stick with it, you'll find you're pretty good at it.
After all, we can all work puzzles.

## Contribute your own lessons!

If there is any interest, it would be fun for some useRs out there to
contribute lessons here.  Both experts **and novices** are encouraged,
especially the latter!  It's like what happens in a classroom, where
only a few students ask questions and the rest are too shy to do so.
Don't be shy!  Maybe do one with a friend.  I'll help you
through the kinks, and your name will be displayed with your contribution.

## Getting started:

You'll need to install R, from [the R Project site](https://www.r-project.org).
Start up R, either by clicking an icon or typing 'R' in a terminal
window.  

As noted, this tutorial will be "bare bones."  In particular, there is
no script to type your command for you.  Instead, you will either
copy-and-paste from the test here, or type by hand.  (Note that the code
lines here will all begin with the R interactive prompt, '>'; that
should not be typed.)

## First R steps:

The R command prompt is '>'.  It will be shown here, but you don't type
it.

So, just type '1+1' then hit Enter.  Sure enough, it prints out 2:

```R
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
```
But what is that '[1]' here?  It's just a row label.  We'll go into that
later, not needed yet.

R includes a number of built-in datasets, mainly for illustration
purposes.  One of them is **Nile**, 100 years of annual flow data on the
Nile River.

Let's find the mean flow:

``` R
> mean(Nile)
[1] 919.35
```

Here **mean** is an example of an R *function*, and in this case Nile is
an *argument* -- fancy way of saying "input" -- to that function.  That
output, 919.35, is called the **return value** or simply *value*.

Since there are only 100 data points here, it's not unwieldy to print
them out:

``` R
> Nile
Time Series:
Start = 1871 
End = 1970 
Frequency = 1 
  [1] 1120 1160  963 1210 1160 1160  813 1230 1370 1140  995  935 1110  994 1020
 [16]  960 1180  799  958 1140 1100 1210 1150 1250 1260 1220 1030 1100  774  840
 [31]  874  694  940  833  701  916  692 1020 1050  969  831  726  456  824  702
 [46] 1120 1100  832  764  821  768  845  864  862  698  845  744  796 1040  759
 [61]  781  865  845  944  984  897  822 1010  771  676  649  846  812  742  801
 [76] 1040  860  874  848  890  744  749  838 1050  918  986  797  923  975  815
 [91] 1020  906  901 1170  912  746  919  718  714  740
```

Now you can see how the row labels work.  There are 15 numbers per row,
here, so the second row starts with the 16th, indicated by '[16]'.

R has great graphics, not only in base R but also in user-contributed
packages, such as **ggplot2** and **lattice**.  But we'll start with a
very simple, non-dazzling one, a no-frills histogram:

``` r
> hist(Nile)
```

No return value for the **hist** function, but it does create the graph
(shown here; it should be on your screen too).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matloff/fasteR/master/inst/images/Nile.png)


<blockquote>


**Your Turn:**  The **hist** function draws 10 bins in the histogram by
default, but you can choose other values, by specifying a second
argument to the function, named **breaks**:  

``` r
> hist(Nile,breaks=20)
```

would draw the histogram with (more or less) 20 bins.  Try plotting using
several different large and small values of the number of bins.

</blockquote>

R has lots of online help, which you can access via '?'.  E.g. typing

``` r
> ?hist
```

will tell you to full story on all the options available for the
**hist** function.  Note, there are far too many for you to digest for
now, but it's a vital resource to know.

<blockquote>


**Your Turn:**  Look at the online help for **mean** and **Nile**.

</blockquote>

Now, one more new thing for this first lesson.  Say we want to find the
mean flow after year 1950.  Since 1971 is the 100th year, 1951 is the 80th.
How do we designate the 80th through 100th elements in the **Nile**
data?

First, note that a set of numbers such as **Nile** is called a *vector*.
Individual elements can be accessed using *subscripts* or *indices*
(singular is *index*), which are specified using brackets, e.g. 

``` r
> Nile[2]
[1] 1160
```

for the second element (which we see above is indeed 1160).

The value 2 here is the index.

The **c** ("concatenate") function builds a vector, stringing several
numbers together.  E.g. we can get the 2nd, 5th and 6th:

``` r
> Nile[c(2,5,6)]
[1] 1160 1160 1160
```

And 80:100 means all the numbers from 80 to 100.  So, to answer the above
question on the mean flow during 1951-1971, we can do

``` r
> mean(Nile[80:100])
[1] 877.6667
```

If we plan to do more with that time period, we should make a copy of
it:

``` r
> n80100 <- Nile[80:100]
> mean(n80100)
[1] 877.6667
> sd(n80100)
[1] 122.4117
```

The function **sd** finds the standard deviation.  

Note that we used R's *assignment operator* here to copy those
particular  **Nile** elements to **n80100**.  (In most situations, you
can use "=" instead of "<-", but why worry about what the exceptions
might be?  They are arcane, so it's easier just to always use "<-".)

We can pretty much choose any name we want; "n80100" just was chosen
to easily remember this new vector's provenance.  (But names can't
include spaces, and must start with a letter.)

Note that **n80100** now is a 21-element vector.  Its first element is
now element 80 of **Nile**:

``` r
> n80100[1]
[1] 890
> Nile[80]
[1] 890
```

Keep in mind that although **Nile** and **n80100** now have identical
contents, they are *separate* vectors; if one changes, the other will
not.

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:** Devise and try variants of the above, say finding the
mean over the years 1945-1960.

</blockquote>

Another oft-used function is **length**, which gives the length of the
vector, e.g.

``` r
> length(Nile)
[1] 100
```

Leave R by typing 'q()' or ctrl-d.  (Answer no to saving the workspace.)

## Lesson 2:  More on vectors

Continuing along the Nile, say we would like to know in how many years
the level exceeded 1200.  Let's first introduce R's **sum** function:

``` r
> sum(c(5,12,13))
[1] 30
```

Here the ***c*** function ("concatenate") built a vector consisting of
5, 12 and 13.  That vector was then fed into the **sum** function,
returning 5+12+13 = 30.

By the way, the above is our first example of *function composition*,
where the output of one function, ***c*** here, is fed as input into
another, **sum** in this case.

We can now use this to answer our question on the **Nile** data:

``` r
> sum(Nile > 1200)
[1] 7
```

But how in the world did that work?  Bear with me a bit here.  Let's
look at a small example first:

``` r
> x <- c(5,12,13)
> x > 8
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
> sum(x > 8)
[1] 2
```

First, that 8 was *recycled* into 3 8s, i.e. the vector (8,8,8), in
order to have the same length as **x**.  This sets up an
element-by-element comparison.  Then, the 5 was compared to the
first 8, yielding FALSE i.e. 5 is NOT greater than 8.  Then 12 was
compared to the second 8, then 13 with the third.  So, we got the vector
(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE).

Fine, but how will **sum** add up some TRUEs and FALSEs?  The
answer is that R, like most computer languages, treats TRUE and FALSE as
1 and 0, respectively.  So we summed the vector (0,1,1), yielding 2.

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:** Try a few other experiments of your choice using **sum**.
I'd suggest starting with finding the sum of the first 25 elements in
**Nile**.  You may wish to start with experiments on a small vector, say
(2,1,1,6,8,5), so you will know that your answers are correct.
Remember, you'll learn best nonpassively.  Code away!

</blockquote>

## Lesson 3:  On to data frames!

Right after vectors, the next major workhorse of R is the *data frame*.
It's a rectangular table consisting of one row for each data point.

Say we have height, weight and age on each of 100 people.  Our data
frame would have 100 rows and 3 columns.  The entry in, e.g., the second
row and third column would be the age of the second person in our data. 

As our first example, consider the **ToothGrowth** dataset built-in to
R.  Again, you can read about it in the online help (the data turn out
to be on guinea pigs, with orange juice or Vitamin C as growth
supplements).  Let's take a quick look from the command line.

``` r
> head(ToothGrowth)
   len supp dose
1  4.2   VC  0.5
2 11.5   VC  0.5
3  7.3   VC  0.5
4  5.8   VC  0.5
5  6.4   VC  0.5
6 10.0   VC  0.5
```

R's **head** function displays (by default) the first 6 rows of the
given dataframe.  We see there are length, supplement and dosage
columns.  

The **head** function works on vectors too:

``` r
>  head(ToothGrowth$len)
[1]  4.2 11.5  7.3  5.8  6.4 10.0
```


To avoid writing out the long word "ToothGrowth" repeatedly, let's
make a copy.

``` r
> tg <- ToothGrowth
```

How large is the dataset?

``` r
> dim(tg)
[1] 60  3
```

Ah, 60 rows and 3 columns (60 guinea pigs, 3 measurements each).

Dollar signs are used to denote the individual columns.  E.g. we can
print out the mean length; **tg$len** is the tooth length column, so

``` r
> mean(tg$len)
[1] 18.81333
```

Subscripts in data frames are pairs, specifying row and column numbers.
To get the element in row 3, column 1:

``` r
> tg[3,1]
[1] 7.3
```
which matches what we saw above.  Or, use the fact that **tg$len** is a
vector:

``` r
> tg$len[3]
[1] 7.3
```

The element in row 3, column 1 in the *data frame* **tg** is element 3 in
the *vector* **tg$len**.

Some data frames don't have column names, but that is no obstacle.  We
can use column numbers, e.g.

``` r
> mean(tg[,1])
[1] 18.81333
```

One can extract subsets of data frames, using either some of the rows or
some of the columns, e.g.:

``` r
> z <- tg[2:5,c(1,3)]
> z
   len dose
2 11.5  0.5
3  7.3  0.5
4  5.8  0.5
5  6.4  0.5
```

Here we extracted rows 2 through 5, and columns 1 and 3, assigning the
result to **z**.  To extract those columns but keep all rows, do

``` r
> y <- tg[ ,c(,1,3)]
```

i.e. leave the row specification field empty.

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:** Devise your own little examples with the **ToothGrowth**
data.  For instance, write code that finds the number of cases in which
the length was less than 16.  Also, try some examples with another
built-in R dataset, **faithful**.  This one involves the Old Faithful
geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the US.  The first column gives
duration of the eruption, and the second has the waiting time since the
last eruption.

</blockquote>

## Lesson 4:  R Factor Class

Each object in R has a *class*. The number 3 is of the **'numeric'**
class, the character string 'abc' is of the **'character'** class, and
so on.  (In R, class names are quoted; one can use single or double
quotation marks.) Note that vectors of numbers are of  **'numeric'**
class too; actually, a single number is considered to be a vector of
length 1.  So, **c('abc','xw')**, for instance, is  **'character'**
as well.

What about **tg** and **tg$supp**?

``` r
> class(tg)
[1] "data.frame"
> class(tg$supp)
[1] "factor"
```

R factors are used when we have *categorical* variables.  If in a
genetics study, say, we have a variable for hair color, that might
comprise four categories:  black, brown, red, blond.  We can find the
list of categories for **tg$supp** as follows:

``` r
> levels(tg$supp)
[1] "OJ" "VC"
```

The supplements were either orange juice or Vitamin C.

Factors can sometimes be a bit tricky to work with, but the above is
enough for now.  Let's see how to apply the notion in the current
dataset.

Let's compare mean tooth length for the two types of supplements:

``` r
> tgoj <- tg[tg$supp == 'OJ',]
> tgvc <- tg[tg$supp == 'VC',]
> mean(tgoj$len)
[1] 20.66333
> mean(tgvc$len)
[1] 16.96333
```

What did that first line do?  We extracted the rows of **tg** for which
the suppolement was orange juice, with no restriction on columns, and
assigned the result to **tgoj**.  (Once again, we can choose any name;
we chose this one to help remember what we put into that variable.)

Often in R there is a shorter, more compact way of doing things.  That's
the case here; we can use the magical **tapply** function:

``` r
> tapply(tg$len,tg$supp,mean)
      OJ       VC 
20.66333 16.96333 
```

In English:  "Split **tg$len** into two groups, according to the value
of **tg$supp**, then apply **mean** to each group."  Note that the
result was returned as a vector:

``` r
> z <- tapply(tg$len,tg$supp,mean)
> z[1]
      OJ 
20.66333 
> z[2]
      VC 
16.96333 
```

That can be quite handy, because we can use that result in subsequent
code.

Instead of **mean**, we can use any function as that third argument in
**tapply**.  Here is another example, using the built-in dataset
**PlantGrowth**:

``` r
> tapply(PlantGrowth$weight,PlantGrowth$group,length)
ctrl trt1 trt2 
  10   10   10 
```

Here **tapply** split the **weight** vector into subsets according to
the **group** variable, then called the **length** function on each
subset.  We see that each subset had length 10, i.e. the experiment had
assigned 10 plants to the control, 10 to treatment 1 and 10 to treatment
2.

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:**  One of the most famous built-in R datasets is
**mtcars**, which has various measurements on cars from the 60s and 70s.
Lots of opportunties for you to cook up little experiments here!  You
may wish to start by comparing the mean miles-per-gallon values for 4-,
6- and 8-cylinder cars.  Another suggestion would be to find how many
cars there are in each cylinder category, using **tapply**.  

</blockquote>

By the way, the **mtcars** data frame has a "phantom" column.  

``` r
> head(mtcars)
                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
```

That first column seems to give the make (brand) and model of the car.
Yes, it does -- but it's not a column.  Behold:

``` r
> head(mtcars[,1])
[1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1
```

Sure enough, column 1 is the mpg data, not the car names.  But we see
the names there on the far left!  The resolution of this seeming
contradiction is that those car names are the *row names* of this data
frame:

``` r
> row.names(mtcars)
 [1] "Mazda RX4"           "Mazda RX4 Wag"       "Datsun 710"         
 [4] "Hornet 4 Drive"      "Hornet Sportabout"   "Valiant"            
 [7] "Duster 360"          "Merc 240D"           "Merc 230"           
[10] "Merc 280"            "Merc 280C"           "Merc 450SE"         
[13] "Merc 450SL"          "Merc 450SLC"         "Cadillac Fleetwood" 
[16] "Lincoln Continental" "Chrysler Imperial"   "Fiat 128"           
[19] "Honda Civic"         "Toyota Corolla"      "Toyota Corona"      
[22] "Dodge Challenger"    "AMC Javelin"         "Camaro Z28"         
[25] "Pontiac Firebird"    "Fiat X1-9"           "Porsche 914-2"      
[28] "Lotus Europa"        "Ford Pantera L"      "Ferrari Dino"       
[31] "Maserati Bora"       "Volvo 142E"         
```

## Lesson 5:  Data cleaning

Most real-world data is "dirty," i.e. filled with errors.  The famous
[New York taxi trip
dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs),
for instance, has one trip destination whose lattitude and longitude
place it in Antartica! The impact of such erroneous data on one's statistical
analysis can be anywhere from mild to disabling.  Let's see below how one
might ferret out bad data.  And along the way, we'll cover several new R
concepts.

We'll use the famous Pima Diabetes dataset.  Various versions exist, but
we'll use the one that is included in **faraday**, an R package compiled
by Julian Faraway, author of several popular books on statistical
regression analysis in R.

I've placed the data file, **Pima.csv**, on
[my Web site](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/FasteR/data/Pima.csv). Here
is how you can read it into R:

``` r
> pima <- read.csv('http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/FasteR/data/Pima.csv',header=TRUE)
```

The dataset is in a CSV ("comma-separated values") file.  Here we read
it, and assigned the resulting data frame to a variable we chose to name
**pima**.

Note that second argument, 'header=TRUE'.  A header in a file, if one
exists, states what names the columns in the data frame are to have.  If
the file doesn't have one, set **header** to FALSE.  You can always add
names to your data frame later (future lesson).

It's always good to take a quick look at a new data frame:

``` r
> head(pima)
  pregnant glucose diastolic triceps insulin  bmi diabetes age test
1        6     148        72      35       0 33.6    0.627  50    1
2        1      85        66      29       0 26.6    0.351  31    0
3        8     183        64       0       0 23.3    0.672  32    1
4        1      89        66      23      94 28.1    0.167  21    0
5        0     137        40      35     168 43.1    2.288  33    1
6        5     116        74       0       0 25.6    0.201  30    0
> dim(pima)
[1] 768   9
```

768 people in the study, 9 variables measured on each.

Since this is a study of diabetes, let's take a look at the glucose
variable.

Uh, oh!  5 women in the study had glucose level 0.  Presumably this is
not physiologically possible.

Let's consider a version of the glucose data that excludes these 0s.

``` r
> pg <- pima$glucose
> pg1 <- pg[pg > 0]
> length(pg1)
[1] 763
```

As before, the expression "pg > 0" creates a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs.
The filtering "pg[pg > 0]" will only pick up the TRUE cases, and sure
enough, we see that **pg1** has only 763 cases, as opposed to the
original 768.

Did removing the 0s make much difference?  Turns out it doesn't:

``` r
> mean(pg)
[1] 120.8945
> mean(pg1)
[1] 121.6868
```

But still, these things can in fact have  major impact in many
statistical analyses.

R has a special code for missing values, NA, for situations like this.
Rather than removing the 0s, it's better to recode them as NAs.  Let's
do this, back in the original dataset so we keep all the variables in
one object:

``` r
> pima$glucose[pima$glucose == 0] <- NA
```

Note the double-equal sign!  If we wish to test whether, say, ***a*** and
***b*** are equal, the expression must be "a == b", not "a = b"; the
latter would do "a <- b".

As a check, let's verify that we now have 5 NAs in the glucose variable:

``` r
> sum(is.na(pima$glucose))
[1] 5
```

Here the built-in R function **is.na** will return a vector of TRUEs and
FALSEs.  Recall that those values can always be treated as 1s and 0s.
Thus we got our count, 5.

Let's also check that the mean comes out right:

``` r
> mean(pima$glucose)
[1] NA
```

What went wrong?  By default, the **mean** function will *not* skip over
NA values; thus the mean was reported as NA too.  But we can instruct
the function to skip the NAs:

``` r
> mean(pima$glucose,na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 121.6868
```

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:**  Determine which other columns in **pima** have
suspicious 0s, and replace them with NA values.  

</blockquote>

Now, look again at the plot we made earlier of the Nile flow histogram.
There seems to be a gap between the numbers at the low end and the rest.
What years did these correspond to?


## Lesson 6:  R List Class

We saw earlier how handy the **tapply** function can be.  Let's look at
a related one, **split**.

Earlier we mentioned the built-in dataset **mtcars**, a data frame.
Consider **mtcars$mpg**, the column containing the miles-per-gallon
data.  Again, to save typing, let's make a copy first:

``` r
> mtmpg <- mtcars$mpg
```

Suppose we wish to split the original vector into three vector, 
one for 4-cylinder cars, one for 6 and one for 8.  We *could* do

``` r
> mt4 <- mtmpg[mtcars$cyl == 4]
```

and so on.  

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:**  In order to keep up, make sure you understand how that
line of code works, with the TRUEs and FALSEs etc.  First print out the
value of **mtcars$cyl == 4**, and go from there.

</blockquote>


But there is a cleaner way:

``` r
> mtl <- split(mtmpg,mtcars$cyl)
> mtl
$`4`
 [1] 22.8 24.4 22.8 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 27.3 26.0 30.4 21.4

$`6`
[1] 21.0 21.0 21.4 18.1 19.2 17.8 19.7

$`8`
 [1] 18.7 14.3 16.4 17.3 15.2 10.4 10.4 14.7 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 15.8 15.0
> class(mtl)
[1] "list"
```

In English, the call to **split** said, "Split **mtmpg** into multiple
vectors, with the split criterion being the values in **mtcars$cyl**."


Now **mtl**, an object of R class **"list"**, contains the 3 vectors.
We can access them individually with the dollar sign notation:

``` r
> mtl$`4`
 [1] 22.8 24.4 22.8 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 27.3 26.0 30.4 21.4
```

Or, we can use indices, though now with double brackets:

``` r
> mtl[[1]]
 [1] 22.8 24.4 22.8 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 27.3 26.0 30.4 21.4
```

Looking a little closer:

``` r
> head(mtcars$cyl)
[1] 6 6 4 6 8 6
```
We see that the first car had 6 cylinders, so the first element of
**mtmpg**, 21.0, was thrown into the `6` pile, i.e. **mtl[[2]]**, and so on.

And of course we can make copies for convenience:

``` r
> m4 <- mtl[[1]]
> m6 <- mtl[[2]]
> m8 <- mtl[[3]]
```

Lists are especially good for mixing types together in one package:

``` r
> l <- list(a = c(2,5), b = 'sky')
> l
$a
[1] 2 5

$b
[1] "sky"
```

By the way, it's no coincidence that a dollar sign is used for
delineation in both data frames and lists; data frames *are* lists.
Each column is one element of the list.  So for instance,

``` r
> mtcars[[1]]
 [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2 10.4
[16] 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4 15.8 19.7
[31] 15.0 21.4
```

Here we used the double-brackets list notation to get the first element
of the list, which is the first column of the data frame.

## Lesson 7:  Another Look at the Nile Data

Here we'll learn several new concepts, using the **Nile** data as our
starting point.

If you look again at the histogram of the Nile we generated, you'll see
a gap between the lowest numbers and the rest.  In what year(s) did
those really low values occur?  Let's plot the data:

``` r
> plot(Nile)
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matloff/fasteR/master/inst/images/NileOverTime.png)

Looks like maybe 1912 or so.  Is this an error?  Or was there some big
historical event then?  This would require more than R to track down,
but at least R can tell us which year or years correspond to the
unusually low flow.  Here is how:

We see from the graph that the unusually low value was below 600.  We
can use R's **which** function to see when that occurred:

``` r
> which(Nile < 600)       
[1] 43
```

As before, make sure to understand what happened in this code.  The
expression "Nile < 600" yields 100 TRUEs and FALSEs.  The **which**
then tells us which of those were TRUEs.

So, element 43 is the culprit here, corresponding to year 1871+42=1913.  Again, 
we would have to find supplementary information in order
to decide whether this is a genuine value or an error.

Of course, since this is a small dataset, we could have just printed out the
entire data and visually scanned it for a low number.  But what if the
length of the data vector had been 100,000 instead of 100?  Then the
visual approach wouldn't work.  Moreover, a goal of programming is to
automate tasks, rather than doing them by hand.

<blockquote>

**Your Turn:**  There appear to be some unusually high values as well,
e.g. one around 1875.  Determine which year this was, using the
techniques presented here.  Also, try some similar analysis on the
built-in **AirPassengers** data.  Can you guess why those peaks are
occurring?

</blockquote>

Here is another point:  That function **plot** is not quite so innocuous
as it may seem.

``` r
> plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg)
```

In contrast to the previous plot, in which our data were on the vertical
axis and time was on the horizontal, now we are plotting *two* datasets,
against each other.

There are a couple of important points here.  First, as we might guess,
we see that the heavier cars tended to get poorer gas mileage.  But
here's more:  That **plot** function is pretty smart!

Why?  Well, **plot** knew to take different actions for different input
types.  When we fed it a single vector, it plotted those numbers against
time.  When we fed it two vectors, it knew to do a scatter plot.

In fact, **plot** was even smarter than that.  It noticed that **Nile**
is not just of **'numeric'** type, but also of another class, **'ts'**
("time series"):

``` r
> is.numeric(Nile)
[1] TRUE
> class(Nile)
[1] "ts"
```

So, it put years on the horizontal axis, instead of indices 1,2,3,...

And one more thing:  Say we wanted to know the flow in the year 1925.
The data start at 1871, so 1925 is 1925 - 1871 = 54 years later.  The
flow for that year is in element 1+44 = 55.

``` r
> Nile[55]
[1] 698
```

OK, but why did we do this arithmetic ourselves?  We should have R do
it:

``` r
> Nile[1925 - 1871 + 1]
[1] 698
```

R did the computation 1925 - 1871 + 1 itself, yielding 55, then looked
up the value of **Nile[55]**.  This is the start of your path to
programming.

## Pause to Reflect

How does one build a house?  There of course is no set formula.  One has
various tools and materials, and the goal is to put these together in a
creative way to produce the end result, the house.

It's the same with R.  The tools here are the various functions, e.g.
**mean** and **which**, and the materials are one's data.  One then must
creatively put them together to achieve one's goal, say ferreting out
patterns in ridership in a public transportation system.  Again, it is a
creative process; there is no formula for anything.  But that is what
makes it fun, like solving a puzzle.

And...we can combine various functions in order to build *our own*
functions.  This will come in future lessons.

## Lesson 8:  (under construction)
