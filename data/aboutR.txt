What is R?

Introduction to R

   R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
   It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
   which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
   Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a
   different implementation of S. There are some important differences,
   but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

   R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
   modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
   classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly
   extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research
   in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to
   participation in that activity.

   One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed
   publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
   symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the
   defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains
   full control.

   R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software
   Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It
   compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar
   systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

The R environment

   R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation,
   calculation and graphical display. It includes
     * an effective data handling and storage facility,
     * a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular
       matrices,
     * a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for
       data analysis,
     * graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen
       or on hardcopy, and
     * a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which
       includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and
       input and output facilities.

   The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully
   planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of
   very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with
   other data analysis software.

   R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows
   users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much
   of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it
   easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For
   computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked
   and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R
   objects directly.

   Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it
   as an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented.
   R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages
   supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through
   the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern
   statistics.

   R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply
   comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in
   hardcopy.
